This will be our project, and we will focus on this until we finish it.
I do not care how long this takes, but We will get this done.

So essentially there will be a 

1. Sign up/Login page
2. Backpack creation
    to store the pokemon
3. Search bar for finding the pokemon

Lets start with the initial page --> What will be on it.

The User has the option to sign up if they want to save their data
Otherwise they can just create a bagpack and start to add pokemon in it.
